I love complexity. I believe complexity adds some spice to life. It is challenging and it can be fun. Software systems however are best when design with simplicity in mind. My definition of a simple solution is one that does the minimally complex while providing the highest rewards in terms of speed of delivery of future features, maintainability of the codebase, deployment, scalability, performance, and financial cost.

CQRS falls into the category of the more complex architectural solutions. It has a lot of advantages like....[Expand] But...[EXPAND: cost, maintenance]

Please note that I am referring to full blown CQRS, i.e including event sourcing. I have not done any investigation on using CQRS without event sourcing.

It is not a silver bullet. I see it more like a technique that, if used under the right circumstance would provide immense benefit, but if used haphazardly could hurt you.

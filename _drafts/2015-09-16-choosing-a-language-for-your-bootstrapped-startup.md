Programming languages. Tons of them have emerged over the years. Some decent great ones. Some decent ones. Some pretty awful ones as well. Most of strong points. All of have weak points. So, which one to c

So, what language should you choose? What should you do to determine which is most appropriate for your organization? This is especially when your funds are limited.

Often time I hear/read folks claiming that it doesn't matter. Just pick one and roll with it. Well...it does!

We often hear the expression "use the best tool for the job". To me Programming languages are more like weapons you can use to slash problems. Choosing the right Programming language (and related stack) is one very important decision that might have an impact on the future of your product and, by extension, your company. The programming language (and related stack) will determine how quickly you can get to market, how quickly you can deliver updates and fixes, how easily you can field your engineering staff with Devs that can become productive quickly, and how quickly you can adopt new programming/architectural paradigms.

Sure with the advent of Docker and Microservices, you could theoretically use an assortment of programming languages. What you'll find however is that someone will have to support the software built on those different languages that used different stacks that produced different errors under similar circumstances. That's the reason why a lot of the big boys tend to have platform/infrastructure teams who consolidate the tech stack that is used. (EXPAND)

Here are some criterias to consider, listed in an unashamedely subjective order of importance:

- What frameworks and tools (the tech stack) would be available to me that would help me build my stuff quicker?
- How quickly and easily will it be to evolve and maintain my system over time?
- How hard or easy would it be to ship artifcats (libraries/executables) on that stack?
- How quickly can I gain proficiency on the language?
- How active is the community supporting that language?
- How many other folks know that language/tech stack?
- How quickly can other folks get up to speed on that language/tech stack?
  - How much level of expertise (Junior/Mid/Senior level Engineer) would be required to gain proficiency on it?
- How familiar am I with the language?

# The tech stack to Get Things Done (GTD)

How fast is the compilation of projects?

# Evolution and Maintenance

# Deployment

# Community support

# Pool of developers

# Ramp up time for new team members

# How familiar am I with the language?

Why does this matter? The more familiar you are with something, the fastest it "could" be for you to get started and ship your product.

That doesn't necessarily mean that you should always go with the language you know best. If you are a solid FORTRAN programmer, you may find it a while lot easier for you to start coding your big idea in FORTRAN. It saves you from having to learn a new language and tech stack. That doesn't necessarily make it the right choice. Support for Restful APIs, for connecting to high volume database (Cassandra, etc...) and ease of deployment could be an issue. Not to mention that I dont know many Devs who dream to work on a startup that uses FORTRAN (but I may very well be wrong).

If however you are familiar with a language that provides you a lot of benefits like ease of deployment, easy concurrency, a plethora of mature framework, a striving community and plenty of potential hires, it could very well be the better choice to go with it

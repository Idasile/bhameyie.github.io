This blog is meant document thoughts and experiments so that they can be useful to myself and others interested in similar topics, and to contribute to the tech community at large. It also serves as a replacement for <a href="http://www.bhameyie.wordpress.com"> my previous blog</a>

The title "47 ronin" is in reference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-seven_Ronin"> japanese tale of the same name</a>. As the story relates to 47 ronin (i.e. leaderless samurai) who coordinated their effort to achieve a common goal, I thought it appropriate to use as the title of a blog about distributed systems (decoupled and sometime leaderless 'entities'/actors/services which work together to achieve their intended purpose).

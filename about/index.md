My name is Boguste Hameyie and I am Software Engineer. I write about tech, startups and architecture. Once upon a time, I used to blog [here](http://www.bhameyie.wordpress.com). **Feel free to send me a DM on [twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}) if you're looking for free advices on challenging technical problems**.

## About this blog
The title "47 ronin" is in reference to the [japanese tale of the same name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-seven_Ronin). As the story relates to 47 ronin (i.e. leaderless samurai) who coordinated their effort to achieve a common goal, I thought it appropriate to use as the title of a blog about distributed systems (decoupled and sometime leaderless 'entities'/actors/services which work together to achieve their intended purpose).

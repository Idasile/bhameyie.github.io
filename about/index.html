<p>The title "47 ronin" is in reference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-seven_Ronin"> japanese tale of the same name</a>. As the story relates to 47 ronin (i.e. leaderless samurai) who coordinated their effort to achieve a common goal, I thought it appropriate to use as the title of a blog about distributed systems (decoupled and sometime leaderless 'entities'/actors/services which work together to achieve their intended purpose).</p>
